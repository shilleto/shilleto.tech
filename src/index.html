    text2: I plan to use this static site as a test bed for experimenting with different site optimising techniques effect on the SEO ranking of the page. The first aim for the page is to increase the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/">Google Page Speed</a> to 100. Following that I will experiment with how live feed content affects the page's ranking.
